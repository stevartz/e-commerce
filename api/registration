- send user details { username, email, password }: POST
  /api/v1/users
  GET: retrieve all users
  GET with {id}: retrieve a single user
  POST: creating a user

  * Implementation
    + This request to be traced
    + We want this to not be blocked by security
    + We will check if user already exists (exception handling in REST level)

    + response object for rest api (post) ? response status code? 201 with location in header

- create the user, send email with verification token

- verify the token
